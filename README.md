YouTube changed its page structure, so I updated the script. Also add support to hide videos on right side of the video watching page.

YouTube has once again changed its page structure. With help from [@misspent](https://github.com/misspent), I've updated the script accordingly.

# Introduction

This is a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script. When enabled, hover over a YouTube video's thumbnail (the image icon of the video) with your mouse while hoding down ctrl key will click "Not interested". If holding down alt key instead, "Don't recommend this channel" will be clicked.
